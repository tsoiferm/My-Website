        <p class="about-section1">I'm Tyler Soiferman, a senior CS Major at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, NJ. Ever since I read the book "Factfulness" by Hans Rosling, I've been fascinated with the power data has to transform the world around us. Over the course of my studies thus far, I've gotten to experience first hand how data can be used to forecast the future, or provide eye opening visualizations. In general, Data Science, Data Analytics, and Machine Learning play vital roles in transforming the world around us for the better, and it is my goal to contribute to the bettering of society via these fields. I am constantly pursuing new opportunities to apply Data Science to everyday issues, and to build a career in such a crucial and fascinating field is a true honor.</p>
        <p class="about-section2">Outside of my passion for Data Science, I enjoy several other hobbies as well; for as long as I can remember, I've loved to sing. Performing at open mics is an opportunity I rarely pass up, as I love brightening people's days and nights through music. Additionally, over the last several years I have pursued my interest in photography; the photos on the home page of this website were taken by me, and some more of my favorites are below! Thank you for reading more about me!</p>
