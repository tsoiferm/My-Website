        <p class="about-section1">I'm Tyler Soiferman, a senior CS Major at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, NJ. Ever since I read the book "Factfulness" by Hans Rosling, I've been fascinated with the power data has to transform the world around us. Over the course of my studies thus far, I've gotten to experience first hand how data can be used to forecast the future, or provide eye opening visualizations. In general, Data Science, Data Analytics, and Machine Learning play vital roles in transforming the world around us for the better, and it is my goal to contribute to the bettering of society via these fields. Over the past several years, I‚Äôve gained valuable experience in Data Science/Analytics and Computer Science in general. I interned as a Global Technology Summer Analyst at Bank of America, where I helped to streamline and automate the analytics process necessary for the upcoming transition to the T+1 standard settlements cycle. I‚Äôve also interned as a Data Analyst at Dot Loves Data, a Wellington, New Zealand based company, where I coauthored a natural language processing research paper that has since been published in an international journal. As a personal project, I built a machine learning web application that uses a convolutional neural network to classify banana freshness. Additionally, I worked in an Agile team of seven employing Scrum methodology while developing a Wordle inspired video game. All of these experiences have vastly increased my skill set as a Data Scientist and Analyst. I am constantly pursuing new opportunities to apply Data Science to everyday issues, and to build a career in such a crucial and fascinating field is a true honor.</p>
        <p class="about-section2">Outside of my passion for Data Science, I enjoy several other hobbies as well; for as long as I can remember, I've loved to sing. Performing at open mics is an opportunity I rarely pass up, as I love brightening people's days and nights through music. I am also an avid fan of professional wrestling and MMA! Finally, over the last several years I have pursued my interest in photography; the photos on the home page of this website were taken by me, and some more of my favorites are below for your viewing pleasure! Thank you for reading more about me!</p>
